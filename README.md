# RLC_solver
This program asks the user for the valeus of:
  - Equivalent resistence;
  - Equivalent capacitance;
  - Equivalent inductance;
  - Initial conditions (currente, voltage); and
  - Sources values (if any)

and in exchenges, gives you the equation for a simple RLC circuit, serial or parallel. 

An english verison is provided in this repo, as well as a portuguese one, for my countrymen and countrywomen.
